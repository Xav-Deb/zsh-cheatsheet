# 🚀 Zsh Cheatsheet — Essential Commands and Tricks

**zsh-cheatsheet** is a lightweight, context-aware interactive documentation tool for your terminal. It provides instant access to common commands and patterns through a native ZLE widget, ensuring you never have to leave your shell to look up syntax.

## ⚡️ About the Project

This repository serves two purposes:

1. **A Zsh Plugin**: A ZLE (Zsh Line Editor) integration that captures your current command and displays the relevant cheat sheet using `fzf`.
2. **A Curated Database**: A collection of high-quality, practical Markdown cheat sheets for developers and power users.

It is designed for speed, portability (macOS/Linux), and minimal friction.
